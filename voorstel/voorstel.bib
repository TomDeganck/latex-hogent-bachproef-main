	abstract     = {This chapter covers the key aspects of sign-language recognition (SLR), starting with a brief introduction to the motivations and requirements, followed by a pr{\'e}cis of sign linguistics and their impact on the field. The types of data available and the relative merits are explored allowing examination of the features which can be extracted. Classifying the manual aspects of sign (similar to gestures) is then discussed from a tracking and non-tracking viewpoint before summarising some of the approaches to the non-manual aspects of sign languages. Methods for combining the sign classification results into full SLR are given showing the progression towards speech recognition techniques and the further adaptations required for the sign specific case. Finally the current frontiers are discussed and the recent research presented. This covers the task of continuous sign recognition, the work towards true signer independence, how to effectively combine the different modalities of sign, making use of the current linguistic research and adapting to larger more noisy data sets.},

De focus ligt op het manuele gedeelte van gebaren, d.w.z. de vier parameters handvorm, ori\"{e}ntatie van de hand, articulatieplaats en beweging van het gebaar. De basis voor de fonologische beschrijving is een gedetailleerde fonetische transcriptie van een 2400-tal ge\"{\i}soleerde VGT-gebaren (gebaren in citeervorm), getranscribeerd met een vereenvoudigde versie van SignPhon (Crasborn et al. 1997).

	abstract     = {In sign language video, the hand region is small, the resolution is low, the motion speed is fast, and there are cross occlusion and blur phenomena, which have a great impact on sign language recognition rate and speed, and are important factors restricting sign language recognition performance. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an improved 3D-ResNet sign language recognition algorithm with enhanced hand features, aiming to highlight the features of both hands, solve the problem of missing more effective information when relying only on global features, and improve the accuracy of sign language recognition. The proposed method has two improvements. Firstly, the algorithm detects the left and right hand regions based on the improved EfficientDet network, uses the improved Bi-FPN module and dual channel and spatial attention module are used to enhance the detection ability of the network for small targets like hand. Secondly, the improved residual module is used to improve the 3D-ResNet18 network to extract sign language features. The global, the left-hand and the right-hand image sequences are divided into three branches for feature extraction and fusion, so as to strengthen the attention to hand features, strengthen the representation ability of sign language features, and achieve the purpose of improving the accuracy of sign language recognition. In order to verify the performance of this algorithm, a series of experiments are carried out on CSL dataset. For example, in the experiments of hand detection algorithm and sign language recognition algorithm, the performance indicators such as Top-N, mAP, FLOPs and Parm are applied to find the optimal algorithm framework. The experimental results show that the Top1 recognition accuracy of this algorithm reaches 91.12\%, which is more than 10\% higher than that of C3D, P3D and 3D-ResNet basic networks. From the performance indicators of Top-N, mAP, FLOPs, Parm and so on, the performance of the algorithm in this paper is better than several algorithms in recent three years, such as I3D+BLSTM, B3D ResNet, AM-ResC3D+RCNN and so on. The results show that the hand detection network with enhanced hand features and three-dimensional convolutional neural network proposed in this paper can achieve higher accuracy of sign language recognition.},

		Het Corpus VGT is een verzameling van video's in Vlaamse Gebarentaal. We verzamelden in totaal meer dan 5 TB of 140 uren video. 120 dove mensen werkten mee aan het Corpus VGT als informanten. Bij het selecteren van de informanten werd rekening gehouden met leeftijd, regio en gender. Per twee gaven we hen een reeks thema's om over te praten: vertellen van een verhaal, maken van afspraken, discussi\"{e}ren over een thema, vertellen over hun schooltijd enz. Deze conversaties namen we op video op en we monteerden ze per opdracht. De gesprekken in Vlaamse Gebarentaal annoteerden we vervolgens door ze te glossen.

		Het Corpus VGT is gemaakt om onderzoek naar Vlaamse Gebarentaal te doen. Omdat er in andere landen ook al gebarentaalcorpora zijn samengesteld, kan men ook vergelijkend onderzoek tussen Vlaamse Gebarentaal en andere gebarentalen doen. Daarnaast kunnen docenten het corpus gebruiken in hun lessen Vlaamse Gebarentaal. Het Corpus VGT is ook een middel om Vlaamse Gebarentaal en aspecten van de Vlaamse Dovencultuur te documenteren en te bewaren.
